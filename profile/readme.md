# Welcome to SYNLP !

We are a creative and productive team focusing on a wide range of topics in natural language processing (NLP).

Currently, we are focusing on pre-trained language models, knowledge-driven NLP, and language resource construction. We are open to any collaborations and perspective students and researchers who are interested in NLP.

You can find a list of our recent representative research papers [here](https://github.com/synlp/.github).

If you have any questions, please post an issue [here](https://github.com/synlp/.github/issues).
