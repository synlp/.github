# Welcome to Yan Song's NLP Group !

We are a creative and productive team focusing on a wide range of topics in natural language processing (NLP).

Currently, we are focusing on pre-trained language models, knowledge-driven NLP, and language resource construction. We are open to any collaborations and prospective students and researchers who are interested in NLP.
